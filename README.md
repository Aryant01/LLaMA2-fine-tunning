# Scalable, Resource-efficient AI: Fine-Tuning LLaMA 2 with QLoRA

This repository showcases my technical deep dive into efficiently fine-tuning large language models. Here, I have adapted LLaMA 2 (7B) using QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) to dramatically reduce memory usage without compromising performance.

## Introduction

Large-scale natural language processing (NLP) models have revolutionized text generation, reasoning, and summarization. However, the computational demands for training these models — often requiring high-end GPUs with 40GB+ VRAM — pose significant challenges. This project addresses these issues by integrating quantization and parameter-efficient tuning techniques, making state-of-the-art models accessible even on consumer-grade hardware.

## Challenges Addressed

- **High Memory Consumption:** Traditional fine-tuning modifies all model parameters, leading to excessive memory usage and slow convergence.
- **Resource Demands:** Training large models typically needs enterprise-grade hardware. The approach taken in the project enables fine-tuning on GPUs with as little as 12GB VRAM.

By leveraging QLoRA, we can reduce the memory footprint significantly while maintaining near full-precision performance, paving the way for more cost-effective and scalable AI solutions.

## Core Technologies and Their Roles

### 1. LLaMA 2: The Base Model
LLaMA 2, developed by Meta, is a transformer-based model optimized for various NLP tasks such as text generation, reasoning, and summarization. I have picked the 7B variant for its optimal balance between performance, computational feasibility and development iteration with resource constrains.

### 2. QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)
QLoRA is a memory-efficient fine-tuning technique that:
- Implements 4-bit quantization to drastically reduce VRAM usage.
- Uses low-rank adapters instead of updating all model weights.
- Enables fine-tuning on GPUs with minimal VRAM.

### 3. BitsAndBytes (bnb) for Quantization
`BitsAndBytes` supports efficient 4-bit quantization, allowing to load large models with a significantly reduced memory overhead while preserving nearly full-precision accuracy.

### 4. Hugging Face Transformers
The Hugging Face `Transformers` library is central to our workflow, offering:
- Pre-trained large language models ready for fine-tuning.
- Tools for tokenization, dataset preparation, and quantization.
- Seamless integration with QLoRA, LoRA, and BitsAndBytes.

### 5. PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)
`PEFT` streamlines the training process by:
- Injecting LoRA adapters into key model layers (e.g., `q_proj` and `v_proj`).
- Training only a small subset of parameters, thereby reducing overall computational costs.
- Maintaining near full-model accuracy with a fraction of the resources.

### 6. Hugging Face Datasets
We utilize Hugging Face Datasets to:
- Access public datasets like Alpaca for instruction-following training.
- Preprocess and tokenize custom datasets tailored to specific applications.

### 7. Accelerate for Multi-GPU Optimization
The `accelerate` library optimizes training by:
- Distributing computation across multiple GPUs.
- Reducing training time and mitigating memory bottlenecks.

### 8. Weights & Biases (wandb) for Experiment Tracking
Weights & Biases (`wandb`) is used to:
- Monitor and log training performance.
- Track hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation, ensuring a smooth experimental workflow.

## Step-by-Step Fine-Tuning Process

### 1. Environment Setup
- **Install Dependencies:** Install libraries including `transformers`, `peft`, `bitsandbytes`, `accelerate`, and `wandb`.
- **GPU Acceleration:** Enable GPU acceleration and verify CUDA support.
- **Authentication:** Authenticate with the Hugging Face Hub to access LLaMA 2.

### 2. Model Preparation and Quantization
- **Load the Model:** Load the LLaMA 2 (7B) model.
- **Apply Quantization:** Use BitsAndBytes to apply 4-bit quantization, significantly reducing VRAM usage.

### 3. Dataset Preparation
- **Select Dataset:** Use the Alpaca dataset for instruction-tuned learning or load custom datasets.
- **Preprocessing:** Preprocess and tokenize the text data for efficient batch processing.

### 4. Fine-Tuning with QLoRA
- **Inject Adapters:** Inject LoRA adapters at critical attention layers (`q_proj`, `v_proj`).
- **Efficient Training:** Use PEFT to update only select trainable parameters.
- **Configure Training:** Set parameters such as batch size, learning rate, gradient accumulation, and epochs.
- **Run Training:** Execute training on a GPU (e.g., 24GB VRAM) while leveraging memory-efficient techniques.

### 5. Model Evaluation and Testing
- **Generate Outputs:** Produce sample responses from the fine-tuned model.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluate the model on various NLP benchmarks.
- **Save the Model:** Save and export the optimized model for deployment.

### 6. Deployment for Inference
- **Load the Model:** Prepare the fine-tuned model for real-world applications.
- **Deploy as API:** Deploy as a local API using Hugging Face’s pipeline API.
- **Optimize Inference:** Ensure low-latency, high-performance generation for practical use.

## Key Benefits of This Approach

- **Drastic Memory Reduction:** QLoRA reduces GPU memory usage by up to 75%, enabling fine-tuning on standard hardware.
- **Cost-Effective Training:** Fine-tuning is feasible on consumer GPUs (12GB–24GB VRAM), eliminating the need for expensive, enterprise-grade clusters.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves near full-model accuracy with significantly fewer resources compared to traditional full-precision training.

## Future Work

- **Expanding Dataset Diversity:** Incorporating more diverse and comprehensive datasets to improve the model's generalization across various NLP tasks.
- **Exploring Hybrid Fine-Tuning Approaches:** Combining QLoRA with other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to assess potential synergistic effects.
- **Investigating Long-Term Stability:** Evaluating the long-term stability and robustness of QLoRA fine-tuned models in dynamic and real-world applications.
